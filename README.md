## pwnx

pwnx is a Burp plugin that passively scans for script includes that are
unresolvable.

## building

`./JAR.sh`

## installing

Load the `pwnx.jar` into Burp's extension tab. Burp will have to have a
[jsoup](https://jsoup.org/download) JAR in its Java environment. pwnx was
tested with jsoup v1.9.2.
